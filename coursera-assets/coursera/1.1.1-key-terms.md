# Key Terms

**Delta Live Tables (DLT)**: Delta Live Tables is a declarative Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework in Databricks that allows engineers to define data pipelines as a set of table definitions rather than imperative processing steps. DLT automatically manages orchestration, dependency resolution, error handling, and infrastructure, enabling a pipeline-first approach to data engineering.

**Declarative ETL**: Declarative ETL is a paradigm where engineers specify what the desired data transformations and outputs should be, rather than how to execute them step by step. In DLT, this means defining tables with SQL CREATE TABLE statements or Python @dlt.table decorators, and letting the framework determine execution order and optimization.

**Materialized View**: A materialized view in DLT is a table definition whose results are precomputed and stored, then automatically refreshed by completely reprocessing the underlying query when the pipeline runs. Materialized views are ideal for aggregations, joins, and transformations where the output should always reflect the full current state of the source data.

**Streaming Table**: A streaming table is a DLT table type designed for append-only, incremental data ingestion where new records are processed as they arrive rather than recomputing the entire dataset. Streaming tables are paired with sources like Auto Loader to efficiently handle continuously growing data such as log files or event streams.

**Auto Loader**: Auto Loader is a Databricks feature that incrementally and efficiently ingests new data files as they arrive in cloud storage, using the cloudFiles format in Spark. It supports schema inference, schema evolution, and exactly-once processing guarantees, making it the recommended ingestion method for file-based streaming tables in DLT pipelines.
