# Key Terms

**Auto Loader**: Auto Loader is a Databricks ingestion feature that incrementally processes new files as they land in cloud storage, tracking which files have already been consumed to guarantee exactly-once processing. In DLT, Auto Loader is invoked via the cloudFiles format and is the recommended method for building streaming tables that ingest from file-based sources like JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Comma-Separated Values (CSV), or Parquet.

**Streaming Table**: A streaming table in DLT is an append-only table that processes data incrementally, adding new records from the source without reprocessing previously ingested data. This contrasts with materialized views, which recompute their entire result set on each pipeline update, making streaming tables far more efficient for high-volume, continuously arriving data.

**Schema Evolution**: Schema evolution is the ability of Auto Loader and DLT to automatically detect and adapt to changes in the structure of incoming data, such as new columns or modified data types. Auto Loader supports schema inference on first read and can be configured to merge new fields into the target schema, optionally capturing unrecognized fields in a rescue column to prevent data loss.

**CloudFiles Format**: The cloudFiles format is the Spark data source identifier used to invoke Auto Loader when reading from cloud storage paths in Databricks. It is specified as the format parameter in spark.readStream.format and in DLT table definitions, and supports options for file type, schema hints, and schema evolution behavior.

**Triggered vs Continuous Mode**: Triggered and continuous are the two pipeline execution modes in DLT that control how streaming tables process incoming data. Triggered mode runs the pipeline as a single batch that processes all available data and then stops, while continuous mode keeps the pipeline running indefinitely and processes new records with low latency as they arrive.
