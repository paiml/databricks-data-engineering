# Key Terms

**Medallion Architecture**: Medallion architecture is a data organization pattern that structures a lakehouse into three layers — bronze, silver, and gold — each adding progressively more quality and structure. This layered approach decouples raw ingestion from business consumption, enabling independent development and debugging at each stage.

**Bronze Layer**: The bronze layer is the raw ingestion tier of the medallion architecture where data lands in its original format with no transformations applied. Bronze tables are append-only and immutable, preserving a complete audit trail that supports reprocessing and time travel via Delta Lake versioning.

**Delta Lake**: Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel to data lakes. In the bronze layer, Delta Lake format ensures that raw data ingestion is reliable, versioned, and queryable even as new files arrive continuously through Auto Loader.

**Metadata Columns**: Metadata columns are system-generated fields added to bronze tables during ingestion to track data lineage and support debugging. Common metadata includes the source file path, ingestion timestamp, and file modification time, enabling engineers to trace any row back to its original source.

**Landing Zone**: A landing zone is the initial cloud storage location where raw data files are deposited before ingestion into bronze tables. Auto Loader monitors the landing zone for new files and incrementally processes them, handling multiple file formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet without manual intervention.
