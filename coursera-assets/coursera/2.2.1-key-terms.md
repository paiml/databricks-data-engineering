# Key Terms

**Silver Layer**: The silver layer is the cleaned and conformed tier of the medallion architecture where raw bronze data is validated, deduplicated, and type-cast into a trustworthy schema. Silver tables serve as the reliability layer, bridging raw ingestion and business logic by enforcing data contracts through DLT expectations.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of profiling bronze data to identify quality issues such as nulls, duplicates, outliers, and schema inconsistencies before defining cleaning rules. In the silver layer workflow, exploration informs which expectations and transformations to apply, ensuring cleaning strategies are grounded in observed data characteristics.

**Deduplication**: Deduplication is a data cleaning strategy that removes duplicate records from bronze tables during silver layer processing. Common approaches include exact-match deduplication on primary keys and window-based deduplication that retains only the most recent record per entity, reducing data volume while preserving accuracy.

**Type Casting**: Type casting is the process of converting raw string or loosely typed columns from bronze tables into their correct data types — such as timestamps, integers, and decimals — during silver layer processing. Proper type casting enables downstream queries and aggregations to operate correctly and prevents silent errors from implicit type coercion.

**Row Count Delta**: A row count delta is the difference between the number of rows in a bronze table and its corresponding silver table after cleaning transformations are applied. Comparing row counts across layers reveals the impact of deduplication, null filtering, and expectation enforcement, serving as a practical validation metric for silver layer quality.
