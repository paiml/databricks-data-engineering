# Key Terms

**Gold Layer**: The gold layer is the business logic tier of the medallion architecture where silver data is aggregated, joined, and transformed into consumption-ready tables designed for specific analytical use cases. Each gold table encodes a business decision and is optimized for query performance by downstream consumers.

**Business Logic Aggregation**: Business logic aggregation is the process of applying domain-specific transformations such as GROUP BY operations, window functions, and multi-table joins to produce gold-layer tables. These aggregations encode business rules that transform cleaned silver data into actionable metrics, reports, and features for analytics and Machine Learning (ML) consumers.

**Incremental Processing**: Incremental processing is a pipeline execution strategy where only new or changed data is processed on each run, rather than recomputing the entire dataset from scratch. In DLT, streaming tables use incremental append by default, saving compute resources and reducing latency, while materialized views use full recompute to guarantee correctness.

**Z-Ordering**: Z-ordering is a data layout optimization technique that co-locates related rows within Delta Lake files based on one or more high-cardinality columns frequently used in query filters. Applying Z-ordering to gold tables significantly reduces the amount of data scanned during queries, improving read performance for analytical workloads.

**Partitioning**: Partitioning is a physical data organization strategy that divides a Delta table into separate directories based on the values of one or more columns, such as date or region. Partitioning improves query performance when queries are highly selective on the partition column, but over-partitioning on low-cardinality columns can create excessive small files and degrade performance.
